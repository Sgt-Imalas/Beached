Beached is a large asteroid mod that brings many new features to the game.

**Difficulty:** Medium

Most of the challenge lies in the unknown; with so many new critters and elements there is a lot to explore and figure out. There is also a new end-game challenge, one that will test your knowledge of the gameâ€™s workings and mechanics.

Every new challenge or hard mechanic has a counter added.
