          Slickshells are a relative of Slicksters. They moved in to cozy shells for protection, and lost their ability to float from the added weight. Instead, they slide around on Mucus to get around.
          
          They periodically excrete Mucus if their environment is dry. If they are unable to moisturize themselves Slickshells will desiccate and eventually perish.
